🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains machine learning projects focused on predicting heart disease using clinical and medical data. The project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using Python.

📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and prevention.
This project applies Machine Learning algorithms to analyze patient health parameters and predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease.

The implementation is done using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to understand and experiment with.

⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The project follows standard ML steps:

Data Loading

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Feature selection

Data normalization / scaling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model Training

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Other classification models (if applicable)

Model Evaluation

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Classification report

Prediction on New Data

📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of medical attributes such as:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type

Blood pressure

Cholesterol

Fasting blood sugar

Heart rate

ECG results

The target variable indicates presence or absence of heart disease.

(Dataset used is for educational and research purposes.)

📈 Results

The trained model achieves high prediction accuracy (~90%) depending on preprocessing and parameter tuning.

The results show that machine learning can be effectively used for early heart disease risk assessment.
